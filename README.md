# Diabetic_ratinopathy_detection_using_pretrained_models
## Project Overview
This project focuses on the automated detection of Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) using deep learning techniques and pre-trained models. By leveraging transfer learning and efficient image preprocessing, this system accurately classifies retinal fundus images into five stages of DR severity.
